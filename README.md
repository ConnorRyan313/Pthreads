PThreads
This is a projected developed in my Operating Systems class to demonstrate the utility of Pthreads.
In one thread it counts all the prime numbers from 0 to a specified ceiling.
In the other thread it asks the user for inputs that give information regarding the other thread as well as a quit command.
